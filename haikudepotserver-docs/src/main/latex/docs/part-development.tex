\section{Development}

This section covers how to setup the system for development purposes.  First review \ref{prerequisites} for prerequisites.  The project consists of a number of modules.  ``haikudepotserver-webapp'' is the application server module.  You should configure a {\it development} configuration file at the following location relative to the top-level of the source;

\framebox{\tt haikudepotserver-webapp/src/main/resources/local.properties}

See \ref{config} for details on the format and keys for this configuration file.

To start-up the application server for development purposes, issue the following command from the same top level of the project;

\begin{verbatim}
mvn \
 -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 \
 -Duser.timezone=GMT0 \
 -Djava.awt.headless=true \
 org.apache.tomcat.maven:tomcat7-maven-plugin:2.1:run
\end{verbatim}

This may take some time to start-up; especially the first time.  Once it has started-up, it should be possible to connect to the application server using the following URL;

\framebox{\tt http://localhost:8080/}

There won't be any repositories or data loaded, and because of this, it is not possible to view any data.  See \ref{settinguprepositories} for details on how to setup a repository and load-up some data to view.
