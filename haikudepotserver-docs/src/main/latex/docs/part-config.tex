\section{Configuration}
\label{config}

The application server is configured using a standard java properties file.  This same format is used in different ways for either an actual deployment or a development environment.

A typical java properties file has the following general form;

\begin{verbatim}
# Comment
key1=value
key2=value
\end{verbatim}

There are a number of keys which are described below.

\subsection{Database-Related}

\subsubsection{\tt jdbc.driver}

Class name of the JDBC driver employed.

example : \framebox{\tt org.postgresql.Driver}

\subsubsection{\tt jdbc.url}

JDBC connect URL to the main database

example : \framebox{jdbc:postgres://localhost:5432/haikudepotserver}

\subsubsection{{\tt jdbc.username} and {\tt jdbc.password}}

Database user's username and password

\subsubsection{\tt flyway.migrate}

Set this to ``true'' if you would like database schema migrations to be applied automatically as necessary.  Generally this should be configured to ``true''.

\subsection{Web-Related}

\subsubsection{\tt webresourcegroup.separated}

Some web resources such as javascript file can be concatinated for efficiency.  Setting this configuration key to ``true'' will mean that such resources are delivered to browsers as separated files; less efficient, but easier to debug.
