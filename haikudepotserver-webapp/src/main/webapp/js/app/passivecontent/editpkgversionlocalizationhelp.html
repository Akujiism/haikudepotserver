    The package version localization covers translations for a given package that may differ between versions and
    architectures of the same package.  This differs from the package localization which covers translations that
    apply across versions and architectures.
</p>
<p>
    The page below shows the translations for <em>one</em> version + architecture of a package.  On the left hand
    side are the different languages that are being worked on.  Click on a language to view the translations for
    that language.  Edit the various translations and use the action button at the bottom to store your changes.
</p>
<p>
    An option exists to apply the same translations across all architectures of the same package + version
    combination.  For example, if there is a package "deen" and this package has versions...
</p>
<ul>
    <li>deen - 1.2.2 - x86_gcc2</li>
    <li>deen - 1.2.2 - x86_64</li>
    <li>deen - 1.2.3 - x86_gcc2</li>
    <li>deen - 1.2.3 - x86_64</li>
</ul>
<p>
    ...and you edit the translations for "deen - 1.2.3 - x86_gcc2" and you choose the option to apply to all
    architectures then the translations would be applied to;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>deen - 1.2.3 - x86_gcc2</li>
    <li>deen - 1.2.3 - x86_64</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The english texts are not able to be edited because they are provided in the package-data itself.
</p>
<p>
    When new versions of a package are imported from the repository, the translations will automatically be
    applied if the new version has the same english-language data as the prior version.
