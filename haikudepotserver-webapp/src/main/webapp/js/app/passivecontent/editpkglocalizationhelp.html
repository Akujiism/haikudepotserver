    The package localization includes translations related to a package that are invariant between versions.  This
    differs from the package <em>version</em> localizations wherein there may be different translations that exist
    for different versions and architectures of the same package.  On the left hand side are the different languages
    that are being worked on.  Click on a language to see the translation.  Edit the various translations and use the
    action button at the bottom to store your changes.
